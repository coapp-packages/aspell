</ul>

<h3 class="heading">Changes from 0.60.3 to 0.60.4 (October 19, 2005)</h3>

     <ul>
<li>Fixed a bug that caused Aspell to crash when checking certain Russian

</ul>

<h3 class="heading">Changes from 0.60.2 to 0.60.3 (June 28, 2005)</h3>

     <ul>
<li>Fixed bugs involving several of the C API functions. 
<li>Fixed bug where `<samp><span class="samp">ultra</span></samp>' or `<samp><span class="samp">fast</span></samp>' mode would not return any
suggestions when soundslike lookup was not used. 
<li>Made a minor, yet significant, optimization to the suggestion code. 
This sped things up by an order of magnitude in some cases. 
<li>Avoid using the slow ngram scan except when the <samp><span class="option">sug-mode</span></samp> is
`<samp><span class="samp">slow</span></samp>' or `<samp><span class="samp">bad-speller</span></samp>'. 
<li>Fixed a bug in curses mode which caused word-wrap to not work

<h3 class="heading">Changes from 0.60.1 to 0.60.2 (December 18, 2004)</h3>

     <ul>
<li>Added the <samp><span class="command">munch-list</span></samp> command to the Aspell utility.  The

disappear in Aspell 0.61.  The <samp><span class="command">munchlist</span></samp> script will also
likely disappear or be replaced when Aspell 0.61 is released since it
doesn't work correctly anyway. 
<li>Several important bug fixes some of which rendered some non-English
languages unusable. 
<li>Other minor changes. 
</ul>

<h3 class="heading">Changes from 0.60.1 to 0.60.1.1 (November 20, 2004)</h3>

     <ul>
<li>Fix bug involving checking of capitalized word when affix compression
is used. 
<li>Compile fixes. 
<li>Added an option to disable using the &ldquo;wide&rdquo; curses version in case it
causes compile problems. 
<li>Minor manual updates
<li>Avoided including some unnecessary files in the distribution. 
</ul>

<h3 class="heading">Changes from 0.60 to 0.60.1 (November 7, 2004)</h3>

     <ul>
<li>Lots of compile fixes for various platforms. 
<li>Miscellaneous bug fixes. 
<li>Added Nroff filter thanks to Sergey Poznyakoff. 
<li>The default filter mode when in pipe mode is now nroff for compatibility with
Ispell. 
<li>Added Texinfo filter. 
<li>Added a section detailing the differences between Ispell and Aspell. 
<li>Updated the section on thread safety. 
<li>Other miscellaneous manual changes such as updating the To Do and Authors
section. 
</ul>

<h3 class="heading">Changes from 0.50.5 to 0.60 (August 27, 2004)</h3>

     <ul>
<li>Added support for Affix Compression.  Affix compression stores the root
word and then a list of prefixes and suffixes that the word can take,
and thus saves a lot of space.  The codebase comes from MySpell found in
OpenOffice.  It uses the same affix file that OpenOffice (and Mozilla)
use.  Affix compression will even work with soundslike lookup to a
limited extent. 
<li>Added support for accepting all input and printing all output in UTF-8
or some other encoding different from the one Aspell uses.  This
includes support for Unicode normalization.  Aspell can now support any
language with no more than 210 distinct characters, including different
capitalizations and accents, <em>even if</em> there is not an existing
8-bit encoding that supports the language. 
<li>Added support for loadable filters and customizable filter modes thanks
to Christoph Hinterm&uuml;ller. 
<li>Enhanced SGML filter to also support skipping sgml tags such as "script"
blocks thanks to Tom Snyder. 
<li>Added gettext support thanks to Sergey Poznyakoff
<li>Reworked the compiled dictionary format.  Compiled dictionaries now take
up less space (less than 80% for the English language) and
creating them is significantly faster (over 4 times for the
English language). 
<li>Reworked suggestion code.  It is significantly faster when dealing with
short words (up to 10 times).  Also added support for MySpell
Replacement Tables and n-gram lookup.  In addition, added basic support
for compound words. 
<li>Manual has has been converted to texinfo format thanks to the work of
Chris Martin. 
<li>Reworked the build system so that a single Makefile is used for most
of the code. 
<li>All data, by default, is now included in
<samp><var>libdir</var><span class="file">/aspell-0.60</span></samp>.  Also added a built time option to
increment the major version number of the shared library.  This should
allow both Aspell version 0.50 and 0.60 to coexist.  The major version
number is <em>not</em> incremented by default as Aspell 0.60 is binary
compatible with Aspell 0.50.  See <a href="Binary-Compatibility.html#Binary-Compatibility">Binary Compatibility</a>. 
<li>The code to handle dictionaries has been rewritten.  Because of this
support for the dictionary option <samp><span class="option">strip-accents</span></samp> has been
removed.  In addition the <samp><span class="option">ignore-accents</span></samp> option is currently
unimplemented. 
<li>Lots of other minor changes due to massive overhaul of the source code.

</ul>

<h3 class="heading">Changes from 0.50.4.1 to 0.50.5 (Feb 10, 2004)</h3>

     <ul>
<li>Reworked url filter which fixed several bugs and now accepts
"bla.bla/kdkdl" as a url. 
<li>Fixed bug in which the url filter was coming before all other filters
when it was supposed to come after. This solved a number of problems
where the url filter was interfering with other filters. 
<li>Small bug fix in SGML filter. 
<li>Added code page charsets, ie cp125?.dat. 
<li>Added natural (split) keyboard data file as "split.kbd"
<li>Compile fixes for the upcoming Gcc 3.4
<li>Removed Solaris link hack as it was causing more problems than it
fixes. 
<li>Compile fixes for Sun WorkShop 6 compiler, but there may still be some
problems, especially with linking. 
<li>Included patch to help compile with Microsoft Visual C++ 6. 
<li>Minor manual fixes. 
<li>Updated the TODO section to reflect the current progress with the next
major version of Aspell (0.51). 
<li>Updated to Autoconf 2.59, Automake 1.82, and Libtool 1.5.2. 
</ul>

<h3 class="heading">Changes from 0.50.4 to 0.50.4.1 (Oct 11, 2003)</h3>

     <ul>
<li>Fixed major bug in pipe mode which caused the last character to be
chopped off words before they were stored. 
<li>Minor formating fixes in the manual. 
</ul>

<h3 class="heading">Changes from 0.50.3 to 0.50.4 (Sep 26, 2003)</h3>

     <ul>
<li>Minor changes in URL filter to avoid treating the double quote
character as part of the URL, and to avoid treating words ending in
more than one period as a URL.

     <li>Document fixes in Aspell API

     <li>Small compile fixes, including one for GCC 3.3

     <li>Updated Win32 section since a port now exists thanks to Thorsten
Maerz.

     <li>Complain instead of doing nothing or aborting for unimplemented
functions in Aspell utility.

     <li>Portability bug fixes.

     <li>Upgraded to Autoconf 2.57, Automake 1.7.7, Libtool 1.5 (no longer use
CVS version  of libtool). 
</ul>

<h3 class="heading">Changes from 0.50.2 to 0.50.3 (Nov 23, 2002)</h3>

     <ul>
<li>Hopefully fixed the Ispell alignment error problem when Aspell is used
with ispell.el.

     <li>Fixed a problem with personal dictionaries on NFS mounted home
directories.

     <li>Compiled libaspell-common directory into libaspell for now to avoid
forcing applications to relink whenever a new Aspell version is out
which was due to the use of the libtool '-release' flag.

     <li>Fixed Makefiles so that Aspell can be built outside the source tree
(i.e.  with VPATH).

     <li>Updated the section on compiling with Win32.

     <li>Compile fixed which should allow Aspell to compile with Egcs 1.1.  I
have not been able to actually test it though.  Please let me know at
kevina@users.sourceforge.net if you have tried with Egcs 1.1.

     <li>Compile and configuration script fixes so that USE_FILE_INO will
properly be defined and Aspell will compile correctly when it is
defined.

     <li>More ANSI C++ compliance fixes. 
</ul>

<h3 class="heading">Changes from .33.6.2 to .33.6.3 (June 3, 2001)</h3>

     <ul>

version of Libtool by default.  I don't know why I didn't think to do
this a long time ago. 
</ul>

<h3 class="heading">Changes from .33.5 to .33.6 (May 18, 2001)</h3>

MinGW.  You can even use the new full screen interface if Aspell is
compiled with PDCurses.

     <li>Some major modifications to make Aspell more C++ compliant in order to
get Aspell to compile under the upcoming Gcc 3.0 compiler.  This
included only using STL features found in the standard version of C++. 
(Which means Aspell will no longer require using the SGI version of
the STL) This should also make compiling C++ under non-gcc compilers a
lot simpler.  Please note that Aspell still has some problems with the
upcoming Gcc 3.0 compiler.

     <li>Minor changes to remove some -Wall warnings.

     <li>Added a hack so that Aspell would properly compile as a shared library

included the original words found in Ispell and eliminated the large
size for now.

     <li>Added three special variant add-on dictionaries.

     <li>Switched to the multi-language branch of the CVS version of libtool.

</ul>

<h3 class="heading">Changes from .32.5 to .32.6 (Nov 8, 2000)</h3>

     <ul>
<li>Fixed a bug where Aspell would crash when reading-in accented
characters on some platforms.  This fixed bug # 112435.

systems which don't have Ispell installed.  They are located in the
scripts/ directory and are not installed by default.

     <li>Manual fixes.

     <li>Added a note on not using GNU Make on Solaris. 
</ul>

<h3 class="heading">Changes from .32 to .32.1 (August 5, 2000)</h3>

     <ul>

<h3 class="heading">Changes from .31 to .31.1 (June 18, 2000)</h3>

     <ul>
<li>Fixed a bug where Aspell would not create a complete dictionary file
on some platforms when the data is 8-bit.

     <li>Minor changes to the manual for better clarity. 
</ul>

<h3 class="heading">Changes from .29.1 to .30 (April 2, 2000)</h3>

Aspell.

     <li>Changed the format of the main word list yet again.

     <li>Fixed a bug so that <code>aspell check</code> will work on the PowerPC.

     <li>Added ability to change configuration options in the middle of a session.

     <li>Added words from /usr/dict/words found on most Linux systems as well
as a bunch of commonly used abbreviations to the word list.

     <li>Fixed a bug where Aspell would dump core after reporting certain errors
when compiled with gcc 2.95 or higher.  This involved reworking the
Exception heritage to get around a bug in gcc 2.95.

     <li>Added a few more commands to the list of default commands the TeX
filter knows about.

     <li>Aspell will now check if a word only contains valid characters before
adding it to any dictionaries.  This might mean that you have to
manually delete a few words from your personal word list.

     <li>Added option to ignore case when checking a document.

     <li>Adjusted the parameters of the <strong>normal</strong> suggest mode to so that
significantly less far fetched results are returned in cases such as
tomatoe, which went from 100 suggestions down to 32, at the expense of
getting slightly lower results (less than 1%),

     <li>Improved the edit distance algorithm for slightly faster results.

     <li>Removed the `<samp><span class="samp">$$m</span></samp>' command in pipe mode, you should now use
`<samp><span class="samp">$$cs mode,</span><var>mode</var></samp>' to set the mode and <strong>$$cr mode</strong> to
find out the current mode.

     <li>Reworked parts of Aspell to use Pspell services to avoid duplicating code.

     <li>Added a module for the newly released Pspell.  It will get installed
with the rest of Aspell.

     <li>Miscellaneous other bug fixes. 
</ul>

<h3 class="heading">Changes from .29 to .29.1 (Feb 18, 2000)</h3>

     <ul>
<li>Improved the TeX filter so that it will accept '@' at the beginning
of a command name and ignored trailing '*'s.  It also now has better
defaults for which parameters to skip.

     <li>Reworked the main dictionary so that it can be memory mapped in.  This
decreases startup time and allows multiple Aspell processes to use the
same memory for the main word list.  This also also made Aspell 64 bit
clean so that it should work on an alpha now.

     <li>Fix so that Aspell could compile on platforms that gnu is not yet
available for.

     <li>Fixed issue with flock so it would compile on FreeBSD.

     <li>Minor changes in the code to make it more C++ compliant although I am
sure there will still be problems when using some other compiler other
than gcc or egcs.

     <li>Added some comments to the header files to better document a few of
the classes. 
</ul>

<h3 class="heading">Changes from .28.3 to .29 (Feb 6, 2000)</h3>

     <ul>
<li>Fixed a bug in the pipe mode with lines that start with
`<samp><span class="samp">^$$</span></samp>'.

     <li>Added support for ignoring all words less than or equal to a specified length

     <li>New soundslike code based thanks to the contribution of Bj&ouml;rn Jacke. 
It now gets all of its data from a table making it easier for other
people to add soundslike code for their native language.  He also
converted the metaphone algorithm to table form, eliminating the need
for the old metaphone code.

     <li>Major redesign of the suggestion code for better results.

     <li>Changed the format of the personal word lists.  In most cases it
should be converted automatically.

     <li>Changed the format of the main word list.

     <li>Name space cleanup for more consistent naming.  I now use name spaces
which means that gcc 2.8.* and egcs 1.0.* will no longer cut it.

     <li>Used file locks when reading and saving the personal dictionaries so
that it truly multiprocesses safely.

     <li>Added rudimentary filter support.

     <li>Reworked the configuration system once again.  However, the changes to
the end user who does not directly use my library should be minimal.

     <li>Rewrote my code that handles parsing command line parameters so that
it no longer used popt as it was causing too many problems and didn't
integrate well with my new configuration system.

     <li>Fixed pipe mode so that it will properly ignore lines starting with
'~' for better Ispell compatibility.

     <li>Aspell now has a new home page at
<a href="http://aspell.sourceforge.net/">http://aspell.sourceforge.net/</a>.  Please make note of the new
URL.

     <li>Miscellaneous manual fixes and clarifications. 
</ul>

          <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>You no longer have to hit enter when making a choice.

          <li>It will now overwrite the original file instead of creating a new
file.  An optional backup can be made by using the -b option.
          </ol>

     <li>Fixed a few bugs in data.cc. 
</ul>

compile on my school account

     <li>Avoided including <strong>stdexcept</strong> in <samp><span class="file">const_string.hh</span></samp> so that
I could get Aspell to compile on my school account with gcc 2.8.1. 
</ul>

<h3 class="heading">Changes from .27.2 to .28 (July 25, 1999)</h3>

     <ul>

compile OK on other peoples machines. 
</ul>

<h3 class="heading">Changed from .26 to .26.1 (Jan 3, 1998)</h3>

     <ul>
<li>Fixed a small compile problem in <samp><span class="file">as_data.cc</span></samp>. 
</ul>

<h3 class="heading">Changed from .25.1 to .26 (Jan 3, 1999)</h3>

     <ul>

suggestion list for good.  (If it still does it please send me email.)

     <li>Added the ability for Aspell to learn form the users misspellings.

     <li>Library Interface changes.  Still more to come <small class="dots">...</small>.

in pipe mode.

     <li>Dropped support for gcc 2.7.2 as the C++ compiler.

     <li>Updated the How Aspell Works (<a href="Aspell-Suggestion-Strategy.html#Aspell-Suggestion-Strategy">Aspell Suggestion Strategy</a>.)

     <li>Added support for the <samp><span class="env">ASPELL_DATA_DIR</span></samp> environment variable. 
</ul>

<h3 class="heading">Changes from .25 to .25.1 (Dec 10, 1998)</h3>

     <ul>
<li>Fixed the version number so that Aspell reports the correct version
number.

     <li>Changed the note on gcc 2.7.2 compilers to make it clear that only the
C++ compiler cannot be gcc 2.7.2, it is OK if the C compiler is gcc
2.7.2.

     <li>Updated the TODO list and reorganized it a bit.

     <li>Fixed the directory so that all the documentation will get installed
in <tt>${prefix}/doc/aspell</tt> instead of half of it in
<tt>${prefix}/doc/aspell</tt> and half of it in
<tt>${prefix}/doc/kspell</tt>. 
</ul>

<h3 class="heading">Changes from .24 to .25 (Nov 23, 1998)</h3>

     <ul>
<li>Total rework of how the main word list is stored.  Start up time
decreased to about 1/3 of what it was in .24 and memory usage
decreased to about 2/3.  (When used with the provided word list on a
Linux system).

     <p>Also the format and default locations of the main word list data files
changed in the process and the data is now machine dependent.  The
personal word list format, however, stayed the same.

     <li>Changed the scoring method to produce slightly better results with
words like the vs.  teh.  And other simpler misspellings where two
letters are swapped.

     <li>Fixed the very unpredictable behavior of the `<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">&amp;</span></samp>',
`<samp><span class="samp">@</span></samp>' commands in the pipe mode.

     <li>Added documentations for Aspell pipe mode (also known as
<samp><span class="command">ispell -a</span></samp> compatibility mode)

     <li>Added a bunch of Aspell specific extensions to the pipe mode and
documented them.

     <li>Documented the <code>to_soundslike</code> and <code>soundslike</code> methods for
the <code>aspell</code> class.

     <li>Changed the scoring method to produce better results for words like
<em>fone</em> vs <em>phone</em> and other words that have a spelling that
doesn't directly relate to how the word sounds by using the phoneme
equivalent of the word in the scoring of it.

     <li>Added the <code>to_phoneme</code> and <code>have_phoneme</code> methods to the
<code>SC_Language</code> class.

     <li>Added the <code>to_phoneme</code> method to the <code>aspell</code> class.

     <li>Added the framework for being able to learn from the users
misspelling.  Right now it just keeps a log of replacements.

     <li>Redid <samp><span class="file">stl_rope-30.diff</span></samp>.  For some reason the version of patch
on my system refused it.

     <li>Rewrite of the &ldquo;<em>Using as a replacement for Ispell</em>&rdquo; section
and added the <code>run-with-aspell</code> utility as a replacement of the
old method of mapping Ispell to Aspell.

     <ul>
<li>Minor documentation fixes.

     <li>Changed the scoring strategy for words with 3 or less letters.  This
cut the number of words returned for these roughly in half.

     <li>Expanded the word list to also include <strong>american.0</strong> and
<strong>american.1</strong> from the Ispell distribution.  It now includes
<strong>english.0</strong>, <strong>english.1</strong>, <strong>american.0</strong> and
<strong>american.1</strong> from the directory <samp><span class="file">languages/english</span></samp>
provided with Ispell 3.1.20.

     <li>Added a link to the location of the latest Ispell.el in the
documentation.

</ul>

<h3 class="heading">Changes from .22 to .22.1 (Oct 27, 1998)</h3>

     <ul>
<li>Minor bug fixes.  I was deleting arrays with delete rather than
delete[].  I was suprised that this had not created a problem.

     <li>Added a simple test program to test for a memory leak present on some
systems.  (Only debian slink at the moment.) See the file
memleak-test.cc for more info. 
</ul>

<h3 class="heading">Changes from .21 to .22 (Oct 26, 1998)</h3>

     <ul>
<li>Major redesign of the scoring method.  It now uses absolute distances
rather than relative scores for more consistent results.  See
<samp><span class="file">suggest.cc</span></samp> for more info.

     <li>Suggest code rewritten in several places, however the core process
stayed the same.

     <li>The <code>suggest_ultra</code> method temporarily does nothing.  It should
be working again by the next release. 
</ul>

<h3 class="heading">Changes from .20 to .21 (Oct 13, 1998)</h3>

     <ul>
<li>Added documentation for aspell::Error

     <li>
Changed the library name from <code>libspell</code> to <code>libaspell</code>.  It
should never have been <code>libspell</code> in the first place.  Sorry for
the incompatibility.

     <li>Added <samp><span class="file">as_error.hh</span></samp> to the list of files copied to the include
directory so that you can actually use the library outside of the
source dir.

     <li>Fixed bug that caused a segmentation fault with words where the only
suggestions was inserting a space or hyphen such as in
<strong>ledgerline</strong>.

     <li>Added the <strong>score</strong> method to <code>aspell</code>.

     <li>Changed the scoring method to deal with word when the user uses "f" in
place of "ph" a lot better. 
</ul>

<h3 class="heading">Changes from .11 to .20 (Oct 10, 1998)</h3>

     <ul>
<li><em>Name change</em>.  Everything that was Kspell is now Aspell.  Sorry,
the name Kspell was already used by KDE and I didn't want to cause any
confusion.

     <li>Fixed a bug that causes a segmentation fault when the <samp><span class="env">HOME</span></samp>
environment variable doesn't exist. 
</ul>

<h3 class="heading">Changes from .10 to .11 (Sep 12, 1998)</h3>

     <ul>
