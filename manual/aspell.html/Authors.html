This is the user's manual for Aspell

GNU Aspell is a spell checker designed to eventually replace Ispell.
It can either be used as a library or as an independent spell checker.

<h2 class="appendix">Appendix G Authors</h2>

<p>The following people or companies have contributed a non-trival amount of
code to Aspell and thus own the Copyright to part of Aspell.

     <dl>
<dt>Jose Da Silva<dd>Bug fixes and enhancements to <samp><span class="command">word-list-compress</span></samp>.

     <br><dt>Sergey Poznyakoff<dd>Wrote the Nroff filter.

     <br><dt>Tom Snyder<dd>Enhanced the SGML filter to also support skipping sgml tags such as
"script" blocks.

     <br><dt>Kevin B. Hendricks (and Contributers)<dd>Wrote MySpell which is a simple spell checker library that supports
affix compression.  Aspell affix compression code is based on his code.

     <br><dt>Christoph Hinterm&uuml;ller<dd>Added support for loadable filters.

     <br><dt>Melvin Hadasht<dd>Wrote a locale independent version of strtol and strtod. 
Wrote the original loadable filter support however his code has been
completely rewritten by Christoph Hinterm&uuml;ller and Kevin Atkinson.

     <br><dt>Bj&ouml;rn Jacke<dd>Wrote the generic soundslike algorithm which gets all of its data from a
file, thus eliminating almost all need for language specific code from
Aspell.

     <br><dt>Silicon Graphics Computer Systems, Inc.<dt>Hewlett-Packard Company<dd>Parts of the SGI STL code were used in various places throughout the
Aspell source.

   </dl>

   <p>In addition the authors of some of translated messages did not release
their work into the Public Domain, and thus own the copyright to the
translated text.  See the files <samp><span class="file">*.po</span></samp> in the <samp><span class="file">po</span></samp> directory
for more details.

   <p>The folowing people also contributed to the development of Aspell but do
not own the Copyright to part of Aspell.

     <dl>
<dt>Sergey Poznyakoff<dd>Added gettext support.

     <br><dt>Chris Martin<dd>Converted the manual to texinfo.

     <br><dt>Lawrence Philips<dd>Wrote the original metaphone algorithm; however, he released his work
into the Public Domain.

     <br><dt>Michael Kuhn<dd>Converted the metaphone algorithm into C code and made some enhancements
to the original algorithm.  He also released his work into the Public
Domain.

     <br><dt>Geoff Kuenning (and contributers)<dd>The authors of Ispell.  Many of the ideas used in Aspell, especially with
the affix code, were taken from Ispell.  However none of the original
Ispell code is used in Aspell.
