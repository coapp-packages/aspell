<h4 class="subsection">4.4.3 Notes on Typo-Analysis and the Keyboard Definition File</h4>

<p>Aspell .33 and better will, in general, give a higher priority to
certain misspellings which are likely to be due to typos such as
<code>teh</code> instead of <code>the</code> or <code>hapoy</code> instead of
<code>happy</code>.  However in order to do this well Aspell needs to know the
layout of the keyboard via the keyboard definition file.  The keyboard
definition file simply identifies the keys on the keyboard and which of
them are right next to each other.  It has an extension of <samp><span class="file">.kbd</span></samp>
and all non-ASCII characters are expected to be in UTF-8.

   <p>To identify a key use:

<pre class="example">     key <var>base</var> <var>other</var> ...
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">where <var>base</var> is the base character that the key types, and
<var>other</var> are other keys that the key can produce.  For example

<pre class="example">     key a A &aacute; &Aacute;
</pre>
   <p>It generally is only necessary to list keys which type more than one
distinct letter as Aspell can derive the rest from the language data
file.  For example, it is not necessary to include the previously
mentioned key.

   <p>To identify two keys as being right next to each other simply list the
type keys right after each other.  For example the line:

<pre class="example">     as
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">will indicate that `<samp><span class="samp">a</span></samp>' and `<samp><span class="samp">s</span></samp>' are right next to each other. 
If `<samp><span class="samp">as</span></samp>' is listed as an entry it is not necessary to list `<samp><span class="samp">sa</span></samp>'
as an entry as that will be done automatically.  Also by <dfn>right
next to each other</dfn> I mean two keys that are close enough together that
it is easy to type one instead of the other.  On most keyboards this
means keys that are to the left or to the right of each other and
<em>not</em> keys that are below or above it.

   <p>The default for this option is normally <samp><span class="option">standard</span></samp>.  However
the default can be changed via the language data file.  The normal
default, <samp><span class="option">standard</span></samp>, should work well for most QWERTY like
keyboard layouts.  It may need minor adjusting for foreign keyboards. 
The <samp><span class="option">dvorak</span></samp> option can be used for a Dvorak layout.
