This is the user's manual for Aspell

GNU Aspell is a spell checker designed to eventually replace Ispell.
It can either be used as a library or as an independent spell checker.

<h3 class="appendixsec">E.5 Upgrading from Aspell 0.50</h3>

<p>The dictionary format has changed so dictionaries will need to be
recompiled.

   <p>All data, by default, is now included in <samp><var>libdir</var><span class="file">/aspell-0.60</span></samp> so
that multiple versions of Aspell can more peacefully coexist.  This
included both the dictionaries and the language data files which were
stored in <samp><var>sharedir</var><span class="file">/aspell</span></samp> before Aspell 0.60.

   <p>The format of the character data files has changed.  The new character
data files are installed with Aspell so you should not have to worry
about it unless you made a custom one.

   <p>The dictionary option <samp><span class="option">strip-accents</span></samp> has been removed.  For
this reason the old English dictionary (up to 0.51) will no longer
work.  A new English dictionary is now available which avoids using
this option.  In addition the <samp><span class="option">ignore-accents</span></samp> option is
currently unimplemented.

   <p>The flag <samp><span class="option">-l</span></samp> is now a shortcut for <samp><span class="option">--lang</span></samp>, instead of
<samp><span class="option">--list</span></samp> as it was with Aspell 0.50.

   <p><a name="Binary-Compatibility"></a>

<h4 class="appendixsubsec">E.5.1 Binary Compatibility</h4>

<p>The Aspell 0.60 library is binary compatible with the Aspell 0.50
library.  For this reason I chose <em>not</em> to increment the major
version number (so-name) of the shared library by default which means
programs that were compiled for Aspell 0.50 will also work for Aspell
0.60.  However, this means that having both Aspell 0.50 and Aspell 0.60
installed at the same time can be pragmatic.  If you wish to allow both
Aspell 0.50 and 0.60 to be installed at the same time then you can use
the configure option <samp><span class="option">--incremented-soname</span></samp> which will increment
so-name.  You should only use this option if you know what you are
doing.  It is up to you to somehow ensure that both the Aspell 0.50 and
0.60 executables can coexist.

   <p>If after incrementing the so-name you wish to allow programs compiled
for Aspell 0.50 to use Aspell 0.60 instead (thus implying that Aspell
0.50 is not installed) then you can use a special compatibility library
which can be found in the <samp><span class="file">lib5</span></samp> directory.  This directory will
not be entered when building or installing Aspell so you must manually
build and install this library.  You should build it after the rest of
Aspell is built.  The order in which this library is installed, with
relation to the rest of Aspell, is also important.  If it is installed
<em>after</em> the rest of Aspell then new programs will link to the old
library (which will work for Aspell 0.50 or 0.60) when built, if
installed <em>before</em>, new programs will link with the new library
(Aspell 0.60 only).
