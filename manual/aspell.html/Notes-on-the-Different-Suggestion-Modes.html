This is the user's manual for Aspell

GNU Aspell is a spell checker designed to eventually replace Ispell.
It can either be used as a library or as an independent spell checker.

<h4 class="subsection">4.4.4 Notes on the Different Suggestion Modes</h4>

<p>In order to understand what these suggestion modes do, a basic
understanding of how Aspell works is required.  For that, see
<a href="Aspell-Suggestion-Strategy.html#Aspell-Suggestion-Strategy">Aspell Suggestion Strategy</a>.

   <p>The suggestion modes are as follows.

     <dl>
<dt><b>ultra</b><dd>This method will use the fastest method available to come up with
decent suggestions.  This currently means that it will look for
soundslikes within one edit distance.  This method will also use the
replacement table if one is available.  In this mode Aspell gets about
87% of the words from my small test kernel of misspelled words.  (Go
to <a href="http://aspell.net/test">http://aspell.net/test</a> for more info on the test kernel as
well as comparisons of this version of Aspell with previous versions
and other spell checkers.)

     <br><dt><b>fast</b><dd>This method is currently identical to <samp><span class="option">ultra</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><b>normal</b><dd>This mode will use what ever method is necessary to return good
suggestions in most cases in a reasonable amount of time.  This
currently means it will looks for soundslikes within two edit distance
apart.  This mode gets 93% of the words.

     <br><dt><b>slow</b><dd>Like <samp><span class="option">normal</span></samp> except that &ldquo;reasonable amount of time&rdquo; is not
a consideration.  In most cases it will return the same results as
<samp><span class="option">normal</span></samp>.  The biggest difference is that it will try an ngram
scan if the normal methods of finding a suggestion fail. 
<!-- FIXME: Explain what this means. -->

     <br><dt><b>bad-spellers</b><dd>This method is like <samp><span class="option">slow</span></samp> but is tailored more for the bad
speller, where as the other modes are tailored more
to strike a good balance between typos and true misspellings.  This
mode never performs typo-analysis and returns a <em>huge</em> number of
words for the really bad spellers who can't seem to get the spelling
anything close to what it should be.  If the misspelled word looks
anything like the correct spelling it is bound to be found
<em>somewhere</em> on the list of 100 or more suggestions.  This mode
gets 98% of the words. 
</dl>

   <p>If jump tables were not used then the <samp><span class="option">normal</span></samp> option is
identical to <samp><span class="option">fast</span></samp> and the <samp><span class="option">slow</span></samp> option is identical
to the <samp><span class="option">normal</span></samp> if jump tables were used.
