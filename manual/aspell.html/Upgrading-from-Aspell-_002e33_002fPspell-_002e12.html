This is the user's manual for Aspell

GNU Aspell is a spell checker designed to eventually replace Ispell.
It can either be used as a library or as an independent spell checker.

<h3 class="appendixsec">E.6 Upgrading from Aspell .33/Pspell .12</h3>

<p>Aspell has undergone an extremely large number of changes since the
previous Aspell/Pspell release.  For one thing Pspell has been merged
with Aspell so there in no longer two separate libraries you have to
worry about.

   <p>Because of the massive changes between Aspell/Pspell and Aspell 0.50
you may want to clean out the old files before installing the the new
Aspell.  To do so do a `<samp><span class="samp">make uninstall</span></samp>' in the original Aspell
and Pspell source directories.

   <p>The way dictionaries are handled has also changed.  This includes a
change in the naming conventions of both language names and
dictionaries.  Due to the language name change, your old personal
dictionaries will not be recognized.  However, you can import the old
dictionaries by running the <samp><span class="command">aspell-import</span></samp> script.  This also
means that dictionaries designed to work with older versions of Aspell
are not likely to function correctly.  Fortunately new dictionary
packages are available for most languages.  You can find them off of
the Aspell home page at <a href="http://aspell.net">http://aspell.net</a>.

   <p>The Pspell ABI is now part of Aspell except that the name of
everything has changed due to the renaming of Pspell to Aspell.  In
particular please note the following name changes:

<pre class="example">     pspell -&gt; aspell
     manager -&gt; speller
     emulation -&gt; enumeration
     master_word_list -&gt; main_word_list
</pre>
   <p>Please also note that the name of the <samp><span class="option">language-tag</span></samp> option has
changed to <samp><span class="option">lang</span></samp>.  However, for backward compatibility the
<samp><span class="option">language-tag</span></samp> option will still work.

   <p>However, you should also be able to build applications that require
Pspell with the new Aspell as a backward compatibility header file is
provided.

   <p>Due to a change in the way dictionaries are handled, scanning for
<samp><span class="file">.pwli</span></samp> files in order to find out which dictionaries are
available will no longer work.  This means that programs that relied
on this technique may have problems finding dictionaries. 
Fortunately, GNU Aspell now provided a uniform way to list all
installed dictionaries via the c API.  See the file
<samp><span class="file">list-dicts.c</span></samp> in the <samp><span class="file">examples/</span></samp> directory for an example
of how to do this.  Unfortunately there isn't any simple way to find
out which dictionaries are installed which will work with both the old
Aspell/Pspell and the new GNU Aspell.
